## Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification in the mRNA of many eukaryotic species, including yeast, plants, flies, and mammals. In order to analyze m6A-seq data, we developed a user-friendly, integrated analysis pipeline called m6APipe based on Nextflow. It integrated ten main functional modules including preprocessing, QC, read mapping, peak calling, merging peaks, differential methylation analysis, differential expression analysis, motif search, annotation, and data visualization.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install one of [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run path/to/meripseqpipe -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda>
```

> Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `conda` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

iv. Start running your own analysis!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Update the default command above used to run the pipeline -->
```bash
nextflow run path/to/meripseqpipe -profile <docker/singularity/conda> --reads '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --gzip --designfile 'designfile.csv' --comparefile 'comparefile.txt'  --fasta path/to/genome_fasta.fa --gtf path/to/genome_annotation.gtf
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.
